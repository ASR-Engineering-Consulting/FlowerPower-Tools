<h2>How to install</h2>

This program works with any BLE-equipped/BLE-dongle-equipped computers as well.
To install it on your raspberry is really easy. You require Node (with npm) and BLE libraries.

First, you need a raspberry with a USB BLE dongle. This raspberry must be up and running.
Then you need to install some required tools on your raspberry.

<h3>Step 1: NodeJs</h3>

First, nodejs needs to be installed, proceed as following:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
	
Then do a `node --version` to check if it worked.

<h3>Step 2: BLE libraries</h3>
Then we need to install the BLE libraries. Let's start to check the last version of Bluez. For me it's BlueZ 5.35.
Now we can download the source.
```bash
$ wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.35.tar.xz
$ tar xvf bluez-5.35.tar.xz
```
If successful, build it (It't long...):
```bash
$ cd bluez-5.35
$ ./configure --disable-systemd
$ make
```
And when this is done:
```bash
$ sudo make install
```

Okay now you should be able to discover peripheral around you.
The command `hciconfig` will be show your dongle (hci0). So:
```bash
$ sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

To check if it worked, just do a `sudo hcitools lescan`, if it shows you a list of surrounding BLE devices â€“ or at least your Flower Power -- it worked. If not, do a `sudo apt-get install bluez` and try again.

<h3>Step 3: Build the brigde</h3>
Now, if Nodejs and BLE libraries are installed, clone this repository and do:
```bash
$ ./configure
```

<h2>How to use it</h2>
Finaly, you can wolk on the brigde
```bash
$ npm start
```

<h2>How it works</h2>
* Login Cloud
* Loop (every 15 minutes by default)
  * Get Inforamtions from Cloud
    * Your garden
    * Your user-config
  * For each of your FlowerPowers (1 by 1)
    * Scan to discover the Flower Power
    * Retrieve his history samples
    * Send his history samples to the Cloud
* End Loop

The program relive a new `Loop` only if all Flower Powers have been checked.
